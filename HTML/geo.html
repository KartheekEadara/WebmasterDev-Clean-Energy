            <span>Geothermal energy is a renewable energy source that harnesses heat from the Earth's core to generate electricity and heat buildings. It relies on the natural heat stored beneath the Earth's surface in rocks and fluids. Geothermal power plants use this heat to produce electricity by pumping hot water or steam from underground reservoirs to drive turbines, which then generate electricity. In addition to electricity generation, geothermal energy is also used for heating and cooling buildings through geothermal heat pumps, which transfer heat between the Earth and buildings. Geothermal energy is considered environmentally friendly because it produces minimal greenhouse gas emissions and provides a continuous and reliable source of energy.</span>

                    <p>The cost of installing a geothermal energy system varies but typically ranges from $10,000 to $30,000 for residential installations. However, homeowners can significantly offset these expenses through tax incentives and rebates. In the United States, for instance, the Federal Residential Renewable Energy Tax Credit provides a credit of 26% of the total system cost, including installation. Additionally, many states offer their own incentives, such as rebates or tax credits, further reducing upfront costs. Taking advantage of these incentives can make transitioning to geothermal energy more affordable and financially beneficial in the long term, offering homeowners a clean, renewable energy solution while reducing their carbon footprint and energy bills.</p>
